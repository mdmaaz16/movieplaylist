## Description
Movie Playlist Maker is a web application that allows users to create and manage their own movie playlists. It utilizes the OMDB API to fetch movie details and stores user information, playlists, and movies in a MySQL database. The application is built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, AJAX, jQuery, and PHP, and is hosted on the InfinityFree cloud platform.

**Set up the environment:**

Install XAMPP from Apache Friends.
Start Apache and MySQL from the XAMPP control panel.


**Database Setup:**

Open phpMyAdmin through the XAMPP control panel.
Create a new database named movies.
Import the movies.sql file from the database folder to set up the tables: user, playlists, and playlist_movies.

**Deploy the application:**

Place the project files in the htdocs directory of your XAMPP installation.
Access the application in your browser at http://localhost/index.php.
